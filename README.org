#+TITLE: org-krita

** fork of lepisma's org-krita package
used `:image-data-fun` attribute of org-link-parameter instead of "bypassing org-mode's image display. This approach is used also by github.com/wdavew/org-excalidraw

This way:
+ krita links' image display goes with org-inline-image-display
+ in the bypassing version of org-krita you can always see a blue line in the middle of image, which is gone when you have your cursor on it which I think is the underline under link. It is gone now.
+ set width with `#+attr_html: :width 100`

Minor mode for working with [[https://krita.org/en/][krita]] notes, sketches etc. in org mode.

** Quickstart
The package is not on melpa yet. For installing, I would recommend downloading
the release tarballs from [[https://github.com/lepisma/org-krita/releases][here]]. Or if you are using [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][quelpa-use-package]], you can
do the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-krita
    :ensure t
    :quelpa (org-krita :fetcher github :repo "hermanhel/org-krita" :files ("*.el" "resources"))
    :config
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-krita-mode))
#+end_src

Or, if you are using Doom emacs you can add this to your =packages.el=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! org-krita
  :recipe (:host github
           :repo "hermanhel/org-krita"
           :files ("resources" "resources" "*.el" "*.el")))
#+end_src

=org-krita= creates a new org link type called =krita= that:
- when clicked on, opens krita for editing the file linked, and
- shows the updated image preview inline if call =org-display-inline-images=

To create new files
within the buffer itself, try calling =org-krita-insert-new-image=.
